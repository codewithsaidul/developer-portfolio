## ‚ú® Features & Architectural Highlights

This portfolio is more than just a static site; it's a demonstration of modern frontend architecture and best practices.

* **Modular & Section-Based Architecture:** The entire UI is built using reusable components and organized into logical sections (`Hero`, `About`, `Projects`, etc.) for clean separation of concerns and easy maintenance.
* **Performance Optimized:** Built with Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), ensuring fast initial page loads.
* **Smooth Scrolling Experience:** Implemented a smooth, high-performance scrolling experience using `react-lenis`.
* **Engaging Animations:** Utilizes custom providers and hooks to manage animations, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.
* **Type-Safe Codebase:** Fully written in TypeScript to ensure code quality, maintainability, and a better developer experience.
* **SEO Friendly:** Includes a dynamically generated `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` for better search engine visibility.
